I have finished the first part and the most of second part of The C++ Programming Language
by creator of C++, Bjarne Stroupstrup. The most valuable things I got was the author's opinions 
on Learning C++, and also the best pratice of using C++.

1) Focus on concepts but language details while learning C++.
2) Base on C++ Standard Libary but fundamental language facilities while builing your projects.
3) Clearly understand the programming paradiagm that c++ provided:
   3-1) Procedural Programming
   3-2) Modular Programming
   3-3) Data Abstraction
   3-4) OOP
   3-5) Generic Programming
